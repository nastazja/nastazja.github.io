### Assignments 

**Assignment 1** is a portfolio of practical work completed as part of a 1-week intensive introduction to Python. The project is based on Object Oriented Programming and Agent Based Modelling. The model contains agents wandering around and eating material (data) from the environment. A repository containing code developed throughout the practicals is linked [here](https://github.com/nastazja/5995practicals/tree/master/Assignment%201).

**Assignment 2** is a major project building up a model, application, or analysis from scratch. The repository which will contain code developed for this assignment will be linked here by 16 December.
