## Programming for Social Science
### Assignments 

**Assignment 1** is a portfolio of practical work completed as part of a 1-week intensive introduction to Python. The project is based on Object Oriented 
Programming and Agent Based Modelling. The model contains agents wandering around and eating material (data) from the environment. A repository containing code 
developed throughout the practicals is linked [here](https://github.com/nastazja/5995Assignments).

**Assignment 2** is a major project building up a model, application, or analysis from scratch. The project I chose was 'Planning for drunks'. The details and 
relevant files are linked [here](https://github.com/nastazja/5995Assignment2).
