## Hobbies

Two activities that bring me the greatest enjoyment are **travel** and **photography**.

Luckily, they're not difficult to combine. I love to capture open spaces including *seas*, *skies* and *landscapes*. It probably comes as no surprise that blue is my favourite colour.

In the future I hope to expand my skillset so that I am able to photograph humans and animals in a way that shows their personalities.
