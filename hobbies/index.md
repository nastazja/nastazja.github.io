# **Nastazja Laskowski**
## Hobbies

Two activities that bring Nastazja the greatest enjoyment are **travel** and **photography**.

Luckily, they're not difficult to combine. She captures open spaces including *seas*, *skies* and *landscapes*. It probably comes as no surprise that blue is her favourite colour.

In the future Nastazja hopes to expand her skillset so that she is able to photograph humans and animals in a way that shows their personalities.
